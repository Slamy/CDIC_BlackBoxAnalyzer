# CDIC User Manual

To understand the following chapters, basic knowledge of the Green Book and CD-I tracks is assumed.

If you want to play music, ensure that the audio mixing circuit is correctly configured. Otherwise audio might be muted. The CDIC is usually paired with a DAC and some mixing circuitry to control volume envelope.

## A foreword on sectors

A CD sector is 2352 bytes in size.
A CD-I Mode 2 sector has additional header data of 24 bytes

	00 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00  12 Byte Sync Pattern
    01 42 71 							 BCD Timecode
    02 									 Mode (always 02)
    01 									 File
    04 									 Channel
    64 									 Submode
    05 									 Coding
    01 04 64 05							 Repetition of the last 4 bytes

Due to this header data, the payload is reduced to 2324 byte

## Configuring CPU interrupts

The CDIC is capable of providing an interrupt vector to the CPU.
This feature is used by CD-RTOS in the CD-I Mono I hardware.

    *((unsigned long *)0x200) = irq_handler;
	CDIC_IVEC = 0x2480;

## Reading the Table of Contents

	CDIC_CMD = 0x0027;      /* Command = Fetch TOC */
    CDIC_DBUF = 0xc000;     /* Execute command */

With every IRQ, subcode data from the Lead In area is available.
To calculate the address of the buffer, do this

    unsigned short* subcode = (CDIC_DBUF & 1) ? 0x301324 : 0x300924;

At this position, 12 words are stored by the CDIC. Only the low byte
contains actual data while the high byte is `0xff`.

Example subcode data

	ff01 ff00 ff02 ff01 ff16 ff72 ff00 ff03 ff32 ff00 ff53 ffba

Only the lower bytes

	01 00 02 01 16 72 00 03 32 00 53 ba

## Playing CDDA

	CDIC_TIME = 0x00020000; /* MSF 00:02:00 */
    CDIC_CMD = 0x0028;      /* Command = Play CDDA */
    CDIC_DBUF = 0xc000;     /* Execute command */

Keep in mind that this only starts the reading process.
With every read sector, an IRQ is generated. With the first
IRQ just do this to start the playback:

    CDIC_AUDCTL = 0x0800;

Q Subcode data is available at the same position as during TOC fetch

## Reading CD-I data for CPU processing

### MODE 1

    CDIC_TIME = 0x24362100; /* MSF 24:36:21 */
    CDIC_CMD = CMD_MODE1;   /* Command = Read MODE1 */
    CDIC_DBUF = 0xc000;     /* Execute command */

The CDIC will cause an IRQ for every available sector.
Check Bit 15 of XBUF. If set, proceed to check to check the lowest nibble of DBUF.
It should either be 0 for data buffer 0 and 1 for data buffer 1.
Check the first 2 words of the mentioned buffer.
The time code of the expected sectors should be stored there. Proceed to use DMA
or other means to grab the data.

### MODE 2

Similar to MODE 1 but with the possiblity to filter for data. The CDIC allows multiple interleaved threads on a track.

    CDIC_FILE = 0x0100;     /* MODE2 File filter */
    CDIC_CHAN = 0x0001;     /* Only channel 0! */
    CDIC_ACHAN = 0x0000;    /* Reset to 0, to fetch even audio sectors into normal data buffers */
    CDIC_TIME = 0x24362100; /* MSF 24:36:21 */
    CDIC_CMD = CMD_MODE2;   /* Command = Read MODE2 */
    CDIC_DBUF = 0xc000;     /* Execute command */

Proceed as with MODE1.

## Playing CD-I ADPCM from CD

The CDIC can play ADPCM audio without CPU intervention.
In this example, the map theme of "Zelda - Wand of Gamelon" shall be played.
The song starts at timestamp 24:36:21 and is located in file 0x0100 in channel 0.

	/* Zelda - Wand of Gamelon - Map Theme*/
	CDIC_FILE = 0x0100;		/* MODE2 File filter */
	CDIC_CHAN = 0x0001;		/* MODE2 Channel filter Select which sectors to handle at all */
	CDIC_ACHAN = 0x0001;	/* Without this, the sectors will be written to data buffers */
	CDIC_TIME = 0x24362100; /* MSF 24:36:21 */
	CDIC_CMD = CMD_MODE2;		/* Command = Read MODE2 */
	CDIC_DBUF = 0xc000;		/* Execute command */

After doing so, the CDIC will start the operation.
Keep in mind that the audio playback is not started automatically.
The CDIC will place the first ADPCM sector into the first ADPCM buffer,
resulting into the lowest nibble of DBUF being 4.
When this occurs, the audio playback can be started like this:

	if ((CDIC_AUDCTL & 0x0800) == 0 && (CDIC_DBUF & 0x000f) == 0x0004)
	{
		/* Start playback. Must be performed to hear something */
		CDIC_AUDCTL = 0x0800;
	}

## Playing CD-I ADPCM from CPU

Sometimes this is called a soundmap (Green book) or an audiomap (MAME source code).
The ADPCM data is expected as blocks of 2304 bytes.

At offset 11 in the ADPCM buffer, the coding is expected
and must be written by the CPU. It is not part of the sample data.
[The example sample from frog feast uses coding 0x04](../src/ribbit_sample.h)

At offset 12, 2304 bytes of sample data is expected.
Here an example to prepare data in C for playback

	/* [:cdic] Coding 04s, 1 channels, 4 bits, 000049d4 frequency ->  213 ms between IRQs */
	*((unsigned short *)0x30280a) = 0x0004;
	*((unsigned short *)0x30320a) = 0x0004;
	memcpy((char *)0x30280c, RibbitSoundData, 2304);
	memcpy((char *)0x30320c, RibbitSoundData + 2304, 2304);

Afterwards you can start playback using AUDCTL.

	CDIC_AUDCTL = 0x2800;

The CDIC will start playback of the first ADPCM buffer at 0x2800.
If this buffer is played back, bit 15 of ABUF is set and an
IRQ is generated for the CPU. Playback will continue at 0x3200.
Both ADPCM buffers are played back to back if left alone.

There is no indication which buffer was now played. The CPU has to keep track of that.

If the playback has to be stopped, 2 possibilites are available.

### Stopping with 0xff coding

The CDIC will stop playback if the coding of the ADPCM buffer to play, has a 0xff coding. An IRQ is still generated and Bit 0 of AUDCTL is 1 during the next read to indicate this.
Bit 11 of AUDCTL is reset as well when playback is stopped.

### Stopping via abort

If the CDIC shall stop immediately:

	CDIC_AUDCTL = 0x0000;

No IRQ is generated. Bit 0 of AUDCTL is not set.
