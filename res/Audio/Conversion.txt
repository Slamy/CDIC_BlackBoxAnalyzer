For audio conversion the "ACUSHELL" tool is used; the commands needed are listed below.

1) Prepare source audio
	Source Audio is a WAV file with the correct sample rate, in 16bit PCM
		- Level A, B: 37800
		- Level C:    18900

2) Convert Audio
	* Convert to IFF with the "WAVtoIFF" command
	* Convert to ADPCM with the "Encode" command (select proper level)

3) Prepare for CD-i
	a) For Soundmaps
		* Remove padding using the "Kill20" command
		* Strip header with the "ExtractADPCM" tool (or manually remove the first 54 bytes)
	b) For Realtime Audio
		* Include in "master" script:
		green       file    [ID] from record real_time audio in channel [CHAN#] from "[FILENAME]">
		The ">" at the end instructs "master" to parse the IFF file and extract the audio content
